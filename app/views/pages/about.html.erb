<div class="about">
	<p>The municipal bond market is riddled with inefficiencies. While the tools provided to the public over the past few years have increased market transparency, the beneficiaries have been, by-in-large, on the institutional side. Households own over 40% of the municipal market, yet we still fail to target the real problem. How can we help the little guy? The investor on the bottom on the totem pole needs more than transparency, they need answers and more importantly, an education. </br></br>

	Individuals are needy customers. The vast majority are undereducated and are in need hand-holding when it comes to personal finance and investing. That is why we have created MuniSearch, a tool designed to assist those who need a helping hand in the process of purchasing and learning more about municipal bonds. We hope that by using intuitive design and maintaining a focus on the individual investor, this tool will become a muni investors new best friend. </br></br>

	MuniSearch is designed to be an interactive explanation of all bond attributes. It takes the characteristics of each CUSIP individually and explains them in an elementary way. Using a single input for the par amount, the data will adjust to reflect the investment made. As an example, when clicking on the coupon button, the user will see a description of the coupon payment, how frequently they are made and for what amount. Other fields include, maturity date, ratings, callable features (including sinking funds) and other unique characteristics. Further, the profile tab under each cusip will display relevant demographic information and the necessary information needed out of the official statement. Amidst hundreds of pages of legalese writing, there are simple, important bits of information including: security of the bonds, purpose of the bond issue, plan of finance, important covenants and taxability issues. Using the MSRB data center, we will be able to display all recent trades for a particular coupon as they are currently displayed on emma.msrb.org. Lastly, all relevant documents and disclosures will be available. </br></br>

	In the future, we hope to make changes to the recent trades tab. We hope that by using a few data points, we will be able to pinpoint how much a broker made and how much risk was taken in the trade. This information will provide investors with worthwhile transparency and while this tool does not solve the problem, it will allow investors to ask meaningful questions. We hope, in turn, these questions will turn into solutions. </br></br>
