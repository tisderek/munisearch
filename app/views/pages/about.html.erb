<div class="about">
	<p>The municipal bond market is riddled with inefficiencies. In recent years, regulators and industry participants on all fronts have provided more tools for the public that have increased market transparency, however, the beneficiaries of those improvements have largely been institutional professionals. Importantly, it is individuals, not large financial institutions, who own more than 50% of the outstanding municipal securities market. As Federal Regulators embrace a new mandate to protect individual investors, as well as the states and localities that issue bonds, the need to educate and empower the investor and the issuer has never been more important. </br></br>

	Many individual investors are under-educated and are in need of professional guidance when it comes to personal finance and investing. Unfortunately for the municipal market, the tools available to individuals are extremely lacking and have at times led to some unfortunate consequences. States and localities are also at a disadvantage in many cases as the majority do not interact with the capital markets frequently, and as a result they are subject to the whims of their advisors.</br></br>

	MuniSearch is a new tool designed to assist those who need help with issuing, purchasing, and simply, learning more about municipal bonds. By using an intuitive design and maintaining a focus on the individual investor, this new tool will become a municipal bond investorâ€™s go-to for important information  while simultaneously connecting the lender with the borrower in a direct and transparent way.</br></br>

	MuniSearch is designed to be an interactive explanation of all bond attributes. It takes the characteristics of each CUSIP individually and explains them in a straight-forward way. Using a single input for the par amount, the data will adjust to reflect the investment made. As an example, when clicking on the coupon button, the user will see a description of the coupon payment, how frequently they are made, and for what amount. Other fields include: maturity, ratings, callable features (including sinking funds) and other unique characteristics to help an investor understand the structure of their investments and returns on that investment. Further, the profile tab under each CUSIP will display relevant information on demographics and cull particular important information from  the official statement (OS). It is typical in the hundreds of pages of the offering documents that there are simple, important bits of information to find that will help investors understand investments more, including: </p>
<ul>
	<li>what type of revenue secures the bonds;</li>
	<li>purpose of the bond issue; plan of finance;</li>
	<li>important covenants and taxability issues;</li>
	<li>ratings; and, outstanding debt portfolios.</li>
</ul>

	<p>Additionally, by using the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) data center, MuniSearch is able to display all recent trades for a particular CUSIP as they are currently displayed on emma.msrb.org. All relevant documents and disclosures will be available at all times.</br></br>

	In the future, there are two initial areas where we hope to add to MuniSearch. First, we hope to make changes to the recent trades tab. We hope that by using a few data points, we will be able to pinpoint how much a broker made and how much risk was taken in the trade. This information will provide investors with worthwhile transparency. While this tool does not solve the problem of a lack of trading transparency, it will allow investors to ask meaningful questions. We hope, in turn, these questions will turn into solutions.</br></br>

	Second, with the cooperation of willing state and local governments, we would like to add new-issue pricing information for new municipal bond deals. While the data is not complete, most individual investors likely make their municipal investments within the first two weeks of a bond being issued [ADD DATA ON HOW THE TRADING OF NEW DEALS DROPS OFF A CLIFF AFTER THE FIRST TWO WEEKS TO SUPPORT THIS CLAIM]. Unfortunately, pricing information for new deals are not made public until the official statements are released, which can take longer than a two week time-frame. Hence, by creating a feed of real-time pricing information as an issuer is coming to market, the investor will get the benefit of seeing the prices paid by institutions for the same securities that they are also interested in purchasing. In turn, the issuer will have improved access to the investors, which in theory, should lower the cost of borrowing.</p>
